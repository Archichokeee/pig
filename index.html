    <h2>What is Pig???</h2>
    <p>Pig is a simple word association game whereby players compete to be the first to link to the word pig in sequence without being eliminated and within the time limit. Whether a word has some connection to the previous word is outlined in the rules, though it is ultimately up to the collective to decide through discussion and debate.</p>

        <h3>Coin Toss</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>To decide who plays first (in a 2-player game) players must undertake a coin toss.</li>
          <li>Players must select either pig heads or pig tails and the winner decides which player gets to start.</li>
          <li>In the case of a game with more than two players, whichever player ate pork most recently gets to choose the player who starts- they are the ‘grand selector’.</li>
          <li>The ‘grand selector’ can change their choice of person to start on one occasion if they are unhappy with the choice of starting word.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Starting Play</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>A player can start with any word except for pig, as long as the submission is not a foul.</li>
          <li>A word should preferably be an object, place, person or concept, though not necessarily.</li>
          <li>If a foul is committed as part of the starting word the turn is nullified and temporary blockance is awarded as is necessary and dictated by the rules, this applies in all cases except for those on the first selection, by the grand selector, where the grand selector sees it fit to spare them and select another to begin the game.</li>
          <li>If a foul is committed as part of the second selected starting word, as selected by the grand selector, the foul is penalised, and play begins from a randomly selected power play word.</li>
          <li>A player cannot adjust your starting word.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Admittance to the game</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>You are not allowed to join the game following the coin toss, or pork consumption discussion.</li>
          <li>No animals are permitted to play.</li>

    <ol class="list">
      <li>
        <h3>Repetition</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Repetition of a word results in elimination.</li>
          <li>This includes words within phrases or word combinations, but not words found within other words.</li>
          <li>It also includes the word pig, if pig is repeated in a submitted response the player is eliminated. In this case no one can win and at that point the game becomes a war of attrition.</li>
          <li>Plural and singular versions of the same word are treated as the same, except for in reference to a shift, here they are viewed as the version of the word as pronounced by the player.</li>
          <li>No repetitions can be penalised following the offenders turn, if play has continued.</li>
          <li>Repetition does not apply to articles or qualifiers.</li>
          <li>Pig is a phonetic game, homonyms are treated as the same word, and phonetic repetition of a word, or homonym, results in elimination.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Failed Link</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>If a player says a word which does not link and then repeats this error again when trying to adjust- they are eliminated.</li>
          <li>A submission is acceptable if there is a clear, demonstrable, empirical link with the previous word, and if that link is relatively specific to the two submissions and not too broad.</li>
          <li>To note, Links can be based on common misconceptions and/or stereotypes if they’re widely held.</li>
          <li>Homophonic/Homonymic links are allowed. For example, if a player says the word Fete, the following player can choose to interpret that as the word Fate effectively pivoting the game into a different direction.</li>
          <li>Historic links such as all animals, the colours of pigs and water are acceptable links in the interest of competition and in keeping in accordance with the spirit and history of the game.</li>
          <li>If you attempt a link to pig and fail, the penalty is temporary blockance of four turns, unless there are only 2 players playing, in which case the temporary blockance is 2 turns long.</li>
          <li>If a player does an unspecific, broad link they are cautioned.</li>
          <li>Two cautions result in a temporary blockance of 3 turns, three cautions lead to a temporary blockance of 4 turns and four cautions leads to elimination.</li>
          <li>No synonyms which effectively have the same meaning as the previous word can be used as the basis for a link, as it is judged that this act is a failure to progress the game forward. Links by synonym result in temporary blockance for one turn on the first offence, 4 turns on the second, 16 turns on the third, 64 turns on the fourth and so on by multiplications of 4.</li>
          <li>A submission must be pronounced clearly and at a suitable volume, and must bear at least one witness, if these requirements are not met it must be repeated, if not the player is eliminated.</li>
          <li>A player must play their turn when pressed, if a player refuses, they are eliminated.</li>
          <li>If a player does not understand the previous submission well enough to provide a satisfactory link they must suitably filled in by the previous submitter.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Forgetfulness</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>If a player forgets the preceding word their opponent can choose to withhold said information.</li>
          <li>In these circumstances a player holds the right to remain unheard, unhelpful and unhinting.</li>
          <li>The game will continue as normal, and the player may be forced to take a punt.</li>
          <li>If a player’s guessed word does not link following a guess, and also following an adjustment they are eliminated.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Indirect Offences</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>If a player sneezes more than twice in a game they are eliminated.</li>
          <li>If a player swallows a grape while playing, they are eliminated.</li>
          <li>If a player ‘makes a reference’, on two occasions to a movie or TV Show in open play they are eliminated. For example, ‘on your left’. Players are allowed to refer to films or TV shows, it is merely illegal to make a specific quote- based reference to them.</li>
          <li>If every Friends main character’s first name is mentioned, then the player who said the last of the ‘main six’s’ first names will be eliminated.</li>
          <li>If a player submits the word leg, following the word wicket, they are eliminated.</li>
          <li>Using google, or any other search engines or any other outside assistance during play is against the rules and can result in elimination, if such activity goes against the will of fellow players however if all players agree to the use of it, it is permitted.</li>
          <li>Lying is expressly forbidden during play and can result in elimination.</li>
          <li>All these offences cannot be penalised retroactively, following the turn where the offence was committed, except in the case of solo runs, where a player is playing alone as all others are blockanced.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Sanctions</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>If a player is eliminated, they are unable to partake in open play.</li>
          <li>The player eliminated must pick a trap word and then enforce Law 2 Eliminations Section 6a when necessary.</li>
          <li>If a player re-enters the game following elimination, after successfully invoking Menyarma’s Shift, the selected trap word remains a threat, and if any player says it, they are still eliminated.</li>
          <li>A false challenge results in temporary blockance for two turns.</li>
          <li>If a player receives temporary blockance, they are blocked from playing their turn for the number of turns they have been blockanced for.</li>
          <li>Eliminated players are still allowed to challenge and make light of fouls.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>The Trap Word</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>If a player says the ‘trap word’, the word which was selected by an eliminated player, then the offender is eliminated and the eliminated player who formulated the trap word takes their place and returns to the game.</li>
          <li>If a player is penalised with a temporary blockance which exceeds 15 turns they must create a trap word, if this word is said during the span of their time under blockance the offending player trades places with the previously blockanced player and serves the rest of the allotted sentence of blockance.</li>
          <li>If a trap word is a word which is present on the powerful list of power plays the trap worder is awarded a bonus point.</li>
        </ul>

      <li>
        <h3>Adjustment</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>An adjustment is the act of changing of your original submission to something different, perhaps to avoid a foul only they’ve spotted, as part of a wider game plan or because the collective has viewed their original link to be insufficient.</li>
          <li>A player can adjust their submitted response as long as the opposing player(s) does not link the word to pig.</li>
          <li>A player can adjust their submission if the collective judges their original link to be insufficient.</li>
          <li>A player cannot adjust following a penalised foul as their go will have been nullified and temporary blockance underway.</li>
          <li>A player can only adjust their word once and cannot return to their original word.</li>
          <li>If a player fouls in their adjustment or if their adjustment fails to link they are unable to re-adjust and are eliminated.</li>
          <li>A player adjusting their link counts as an adjustment.</li>
          <li>A player cannot adjust their starting word.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Saves</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>A player can ‘save’ a word on the fly if it appears to be problematic by very quickly adding to it. For example, a player could say ‘spider’, then quickly save it by adding ‘man’ on the end to submit the far less problematic ‘Spiderman’.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

  <div class="textBlock">

    <ol class="list">
      <li>
        <h3>Offside offence</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>A player can be deemed offside if they respond with a word which has the same 3 rd letter as the previous submitted word.</li>
          <li>All offsides are to be called by the opposing players and then assessed by the collective.</li>
          <li>A player can be offside within the confines of their own submission for example: candy cane.</li>
          <li>If a player is offside as a result of both Law 4 Offsides Section 1a and Law 4 Section 1c they are eliminated.</li>
          <li>If play continues beyond the turn of the offside player they can no longer be penalised for the foul.</li>
          <li>Offsides are a type of foul and should be judged and viewed as such.</li>
          <li>You cannot be offside in relation to pig.</li>
          <li>Whilst Pig is a phonetic game in most regards, in reference to offsides word are viewed contextually as the version which associates with the preceding words.</li>
          <li>In the case of multiple homonyms with associations to the preceding word the player has the right to assert whichever spelling is most convenient for them, as long as the association is workable.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Offside sanctions</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Offsides results in ‘temporary blockance’ for two turns in games with more than two players.</li>
          <li>Temporary blockance is still invoked in a two-player game, however the temporary blockance allotted is only for one turn. The remaining player should continue to further their attempt to win.</li>
          <li>If a player is caught offside, their go is nullified, and play continues from the previous submission.</li>
        </ul>

      <li>
        <h3>Double linking</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>A double link is when a player has an undeclared link between their submission and the previous submission. For example, if a player responded to the word ‘beef’ with the word ‘pig’ and their reasoning is that beef relates to cow and that cow relates to pig, this would involve making two leaps between words instead of just one. Double linking, if evidently present, and explained as such, results in temporary blockance of one turn.</li>
          <li>Triple linking, which is double linking with another link within results in elimination.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Rhyme Based Linking</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Words cannot usually be linked because they rhyme, and usually result in a foul, and temporary blockance of two turns.</li>
          <li>However, rhyme-based links are allowed if you are linking directly to the word pig, through rhyme.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Antonyms</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>Antonyms can be used as a link to previous word.</li>
          <li>However, this does not apply to the word pig as it has no clear antonyms.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Multiple fouls</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>If a player commits two fouls or offsides in one go this is a double foul, and they are put under temporary blockance for four turns.</li>
          <li>A triple foul results in temporary blockance for fifteen turns.</li>
          <li>A quadruple foul results in elimination.</li>
          <li>All blockances add up. Any additional blockances gained merely pile on to existing blockances.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Indirect fouls</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>If you make a submission out of turn you are under temporary blockance for 19 turns.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Foul Sanctions</h3>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>If a player commits a foul their go is nullified, and play continues from the previous word.</li>
          <li>Temporary blockance will then be awarded in accordance with the rules.</li>
          <li>Fouls cannot be penalised retroactively except in the case of solo runs, where a player is playing alone as all others are blockanced.</li>
